Since 2012, I'm traveling around the town/country/world with my little folding RepRap !

I started by a folding reprap the size of a Mendel, based on my VertX, then a smaller version more Huxley-transportable, and finally I'm developping this one build with standard aluminium extrusions. The FoldaRap was the world's first foldable 3d-printer (yay!).

My adventures/travels with it gave birth to [OpenEdge](https://openedge.cc), which grew to make even more FoldaRap and Mondrian, then moved toward the industry/education with customs Alto and the HD/HD-E... and now I'm back to my roots, working on the next version of this nice little machine while exploring new business models that I find more fit with the world I envision (i.e. : micro-donations for the design/documentation rather than selling hardware, I prefer to leave that to other people).

FoldaRap, The Folding RepRap
============================
Since 2012, I'm traveling around the town/country/world with my little folding RepRap !

I started by a folding reprap the size of a Mendel, then a smaller version more Huxley-transportable, and finally I'm developping this one build with standard aluminium extrusions.

The FoldaRap was the world's first foldable 3d-printer (yay!).

Lots of pictures/videos on [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/watsdesign/tags/foldarap/)

My adventures/travels with it gave birth to [OpenEdge](https://openedge.cc), which grew to make even more FoldaRap and Mondrian, then moved toward the industry/education with customs Alto and the HD/HD-E...

Since summer 2017 I'm back to my roots, working again on this nice little machine.

While trying to explore alternative business-models : micro-donations for the design/documentation rather than selling hardware.
